TLTWIS
==============================
## Overview

TLTWIS is a Python-based simulation tool developed as part of a thesis project. The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive simulation model for a two-way signalized intersection. The simulator aims to assist road engineers in designing optimal fixed-time traffic signal programs for standard, two-way intersections.

## Features

- **Simulation Model:** The project includes a detailed simulation model that reflects the actual functioning of a road junction system. This model takes into consideration the objects, relationships, and interactions within the intersection.

- **Python Implementation:** The simulation model is implemented in the Python programming language, making it accessible and easy to use.

- **Interactive Interface:** The simulator features an interactive interface that allows users to modify simulation parameters. This functionality provides a user-friendly experience for road engineers and facilitates experimentation with different scenarios.

## Usage

To use the Two-Way Signalized Intersection Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xadambednarski/intersection-simulator.git
2. Install the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the simulator.
    ```bash
    python simulator.py
4. User's interface can be accessed via ```sim_parameters.json``` and ```logs.log```.
## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to enhance the simulator's functionality, improve code quality, or fix issues. Please refer to the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
